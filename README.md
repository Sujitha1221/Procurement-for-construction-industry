This project represents an integrated solution encompassing both a web application and a mobile application, sharing a unified backend developed in Node.js. The mobile app's frontend is crafted using Flutter, providing a seamless and efficient user experience on mobile devices. Meanwhile, the web application's frontend is built with React.js, complemented by the responsive and utility-first styling of Tailwind CSS.
