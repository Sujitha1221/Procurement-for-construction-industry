This project is a comprehensive solution consisting of both a web application and a mobile app. A unified Node.js backend serves as the foundation for development across both platforms. The mobile app's frontend is crafted using Flutter, providing a responsive and dynamic user interface. On the other hand, the web application's frontend is built with React.js, complemented by the sleek styling of Tailwind CSS. In terms of data storage, MongoDB serves as the database, ensuring efficient and scalable management of the project's data.
